# Huffman-We used the Huffman method for date compression. The Huffman code is built using a tree. The construction of this tree starts from the root. The entire set of our encoded elements corresponds to the root of the tree (top of the first level). It is split into two subsets with approximately the same total probabilities. These subsets correspond to two second-level vertices that are connected to the root. Further, each of these subsets is divided into two subsets with approximately the same total probabilities. The tops of the third level correspond to them. If the subset contains a single element, then the end node of the code tree corresponds to it; such a subset cannot be split. We do this until we get all the end vertices. We mark the branches of the code tree with symbols 1 and 0, as in the case of the Huffman code.
